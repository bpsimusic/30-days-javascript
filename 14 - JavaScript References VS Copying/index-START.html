  //JavaScript is like C++ for references vs copy
  
    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age; //age2 gets a copy of age, not the reference
    console.log(age, age2);
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2);

    let name = 'Wes';
    let name2 = name; //name2 gets copy of name
    console.log(name, name2);
    name = 'wesley';
    console.log(name, name2);
    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    const team = players; //team is the reference of players, not a copy.

    console.log(players, team);
    team[3] = 'Lux'; //When you change team, you're actually changing the array itself

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
      team2 = players.slice()


    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      team3 = [].concat(players)
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
      team4 = [...players]
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
      team5 = Array.from(players)
      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: 'Wes Bos',
        age: 80
      };

      const captain = person;  //captain is a reference to person.
      captain.age = 99;

      //how to make a copy of any Object
      const captain3 = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 28, gender: 'male'})
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
      const billy = {
        name: 'billy',
        social: {twitter: 'superman', facebook: 'trudeau'}
      }
      const dev = Object.assign({}, billy) //dev.social is still a reference, not a copy.
      //if you want a deep copy, use lodash's cloneDeep method.

      //Another way to make a copy
      let harry = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(billy));
